### TASK-1b

Using either Python or MATLAB (or any other software/ language), perform the following operations.

1. #### Signal Generation and Visualization

   - Generate a continuous time signal composed of three *sine* waves of frequencies $15\ \text{Hz}$, $25\ \text{Hz}$ and $45\ \text{Hz}$ and visualise them.

2. #### Sampling

   - Sample the above signal with sampling frequency $100\ \text{Hz}$.

3. #### Fourier domain representation

   - Obtain the FFT of the signal with in-built functions and plot it.

     - (Python): `scipy.fft`
     - (MATLAB): `fft()`

4. #### Time-Shifting and Time-Scaling

   - Explore the effects of time-shifting and time-scaling on signals: Apply time-shifting and time-scaling operations to signals and observe the changes in their frequency domain representation.

5. #### Implement Convolution

   - Convolve the signal with itself and visualise [plot] the output.

6. #### Implement Filters

   - Design a simple low pass filter with cut-off frequency of $30\ \text{Hz}$ and filter the signal with it.
     - Use a convolution operation to obtain the filtered signal [Or directly use an available in-built function].
