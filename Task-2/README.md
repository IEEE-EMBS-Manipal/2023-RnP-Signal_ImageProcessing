### TASK-2b

Using either Python or MATLAB (or any other software/ language), perform the following operations.

1. #### Signal Generation and Visualization

   - Generate a continuous time signal composed of three *sine* waves of frequencies $15\ \text{Hz}$, $25\ \text{Hz}$ and $45\ \text{Hz}$ and visualise them.
    - Hint: Use the `plot` function in MATLAB, or `matplotlib.pyplot`'s `plot()` in Python.

2. #### Implement Convolution

   - Convolve the signal with itself and visualise [plot] the output.
