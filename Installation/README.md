## Programming [Python]

Python has good support for libraries for Signal Processing and Image Processing Applications.

- Accessing and Installations
  - If you're using locally, Download Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
    - Install the following **libraries**
      - `Numpy`
      - `Scipy`
      - `Pandas`
      - `Matplotlib`

    - ```shell
      pip3 install <package>
      ```

  - Alternatively, Install Anaconda
    - https://www.anaconda.com/download#downloads
      - Available for Windows, macOS (Intel, Apple Silicon), and Linux

    - https://colab.google/notebooks/
    - https://colab.research.google.com/#create=true
    - Log in using your Google account, and save your Notebooks on Google Drive

- If you're new to Python, checkout the resouces in the tasks section and complete it before proceeding with the task.

## Programming [MATLAB]

- Install MATLAB
  - Create a **MathWorks account** / Sign in.
    https://login.mathworks.com/embedded-login/landing.html?cid=getmatlab&s_tid=gn_getml
    > Use **Learner ID** to access Campus License.
  - Use MATLAB Online, or run it locally *(recommended)*.
  - Download MATLAB from https://in.mathworks.com/downloads/
  - Login with your MathWorks account while performing MATLAB installation and proceed with the steps. It should automatically detect your **License**.
    - If not, then find your License number at https://in.mathworks.com/mwaccount.
  - Install the following **packages** and **toolboxes**
    - Signal Processing Toolbox
    - Image Processing Toolbox

  - If you're already installed MATLAB, and want to browse and Add the packages and toolboxes,

    - MATLAB > Home Tab > Add-Ons > Get Add-Ons

- If you're new to MATLAB, checkout the resouces in the tasks section and complete it before proceeding with the task.
